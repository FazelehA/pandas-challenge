# pandas-challenge

This challenge looks at analysing district-wide standardised test results for schools to help the school board and mayor make strategic decisions regarding future school budgets and priorities. 
Pandas dataframes were used to aggregate the given data which included every student's math and reading scores as well as various other information regarding the schools. This data was then used to showcase obvious trends in school performance based on average spending, school size and school type by summarising key metrices about each school. The result of this analysis together with a summary of a few observable trends can be found in the PyCitySchools folder.
